**An ontology of the Fediverse**
<br>‚Äì _a Work in Progress._<br>
SKOS vocabulary used with redaktor and skohub.io:<br>
We try to summarize all terms used in ActivityPub, including official extensions and extensions specified by their diverse implementations.<br>
We propose mappings and a way to extend ActivityStreams by famous well known knowledge concepts like wikidata.org, Library of Congress, schema.org etc.


The static pages in /docs published with [skohub-vocabs](https://blog.skohub.io/2019-09-27-skohub-vocabs/) are published for now at

The file `Vocab.ttl` is currently not builded.
It describes the roles of ActivityPub Actors (attributions) and Places in redaktor. <br> The vocabulary is also developed and maintained in the context of multiple sources, <br>e.g. https://wikidata.org, https://themoviedb.org or https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators
